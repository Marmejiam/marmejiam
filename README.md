☕️ 🥐 Colombian expatriate in France for 12 years

👩🏻‍💻 After 6 years of experience in marketing in e-commerce, where I worked on implementing mass-media communication campaigns and business development, I decided in October 2023 to pursue a career reorientation and become a web developer by completing a web development bootcamp at Le Wagon 🚌.

❤️‍🔥 I am passionate about cooking, eating well, new technologies, and curious about any subject whether it is useful or less useful.

⌨️Tech stack : Ruby on rails / Javascript / HTML / CSS / Git / Github
